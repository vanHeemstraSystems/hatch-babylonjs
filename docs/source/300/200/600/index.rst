Feature 6: Asset Pipeline Implementation (1 hour)
=================================================

README.md:

``
# Asset Pipeline Implementation

Create the Python-based asset pipeline for processing models and textures.

## Tasks
- Implement texture_processor for image optimization
- Implement mesh_processor for model conversion
- Create CLI interface for asset processing

## Verification
- Process test assets with `python -m asset_pipeline.cli process assets/textures/test.png`
- Verify output formats and optimization
``

Tests:
- Texture processing test: Verify texture optimization and conversion
- Mesh processing test: Verify model conversion from Blender to glTF/Babylon format
