# Python-JavaScript Bridge

Implement the bridge between Python and JavaScript for seamless integration.

## Tasks
- Create Python-to-JS serialization utilities
- Implement bridge for scene configuration
- Set up JS callback handlers for Python functions

## Verification
- Run bridge tests with `pytest python/babylon_bridge/tests/`
- Verify data passing between Python and JS environments
```

**Tests:**
- Serialization test: Verify complex Python objects serialize correctly to JS
- Callback test: Verify JS callbacks can be invoked from Python
